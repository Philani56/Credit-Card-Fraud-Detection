# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🕵️‍♂️💳

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains anonymized credit card transactions with a focus on identifying fraudulent activities.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales features for better model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implements a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Evaluation**: Utilizes metrics such as Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve to assess model performance.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

Load and explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Detailed instructions for these steps are available in the project's scripts.

## Evaluation Metrics 📊

- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of the classification model.
- **ROC Curve**: Shows the true positive rate versus false positive rate, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) indicating overall performance.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Illustrates the trade-off between precision and recall, with Average Precision (AP) as a summary metric.
